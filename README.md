# Why typescript is needed?
  In JS, We can add 2 and null (2 + null = 2).
  But this is not a valid operation. Similarly there a many such issues with JS, that were not captured at the time of development instead when the code is executed.
  We need something that can check the type of the data that is being in the variable.
  
   **Here comes the Typescript to save us :)**

   ### Typescript perform Static type checking. Typescript is just a development tool.

   ## Types available in Typescript:
    1. Number
    2. String

    6. Void
    7. Object
    8. Array
    9. Tuples
    10. Any
